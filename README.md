This is the repo for the Question 2 


To run it: clone the repo then `npm i` or `pnpm i` if you have pnpm. Then run the index.js with `node index.js`.
You should have the page in your `localhost:3000/`. I have failed get the response back to the page, my query works, but
It also gets stuck on the server. This was my first attempt for something like this and I enjoyed the challenge.
